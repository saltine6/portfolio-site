	<p>
		In an age where more and more online services and goods are becoming subscription based - 
		creative software, streaming services, even features in video games - I find myself longing 
		for more control over my digital experience. Every time I watch a payment go through for an 
		online subscription, whether it’s an Adobe Creative Cloud bill or a server hosting fee, I 
		can’t help but wonder if there’s a better, more self-directed way to meet my needs than 
		resigning myself to dependence on recurring monthly charges.
	</p>
	<p>
		With my college application deadlines approaching at an alarming rate, I’ve decided that 
		a portfolio website would help my admission chances with many of my top schools. Starting 
		out on this project, however, I wasn’t eager to pay a monthly fee for website hosting, 
		so I started doing some research on how I could get my site out on the net from home.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few enlightening - albeit painstaking and, at some points, downright 
		contradictory - hours of research, I believed that I understood everything I needed 
		to know about self-hosting a website. I would later come to realize my naïveté, but for 
		the time being I set out to find my old Raspberry Pi amidst the clutter in my basement, 
		marking the first step of my self-hosting journey.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I found my Raspberry Pi, a triumphant victory after multiple days of searching, I 
		hooked the computer up to a monitor only to find that, although the Pi was booting, 
		nothing was being displayed on the screen. Slightly annoyed yet filled with determination, 
		I wasn’t going to let a small hiccup like this stop me. I carefully pulled out the 
		OS-containing MicroSD card from the Pi’s plastic case, planning to flash it with a fresh 
		copy of the Raspberry Pi OS. I would have gotten this over with quickly and been on my merry 
		way, but it was at this point that I realized my MicroSD to USB adapter was missing, 
		preventing me from plugging the MicroSD card into my desktop computer. Worn out from my 
		rigorous search for the Raspberry Pi, I opted to order a new adapter on Amazon rather than 
		upturn my entire house again looking for another small piece of hardware.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few days passed and the adapter was finally in my hands. Without wasting any time I set 
		up my Raspberry Pi with a shiny new OS and got my project back on track. Now that I could 
		use the Pi, my first objective was to set up a remote connection with my desktop computer, 
		which would enable me to easily tinker with the Raspberry Pi without needing to plug in any 
		extra workspace-cluttering peripherals. Utilizing the new Raspberry Pi Connect beta, this 
		was surprisingly straightforward, and having a step work so quickly and easily was a breath 
		of fresh air.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I had the computer working, I had to set up my web server. One of my requirements 
		for this project is that everything hosted on the Pi needs to be compartmentalized, hopefully 
		allowing me to expand its use for more projects in the future without affecting my website. 
		Because of this requirement, my first move was to set up Docker. For those unfamiliar with 
		Docker like I was at the beginning of this project, it allows you to create isolated 
		‘containers’ on your computer. These containers allow an application to run within a single 
		file that contains all of its dependencies packaged together. This compartmentalization not 
		only makes running multiple projects simpler and prevents conflicts between them, it also 
		adds a layer of security once the website is exposed to the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although setting up docker should have been relatively straightforward, a hidden requirement 
		increased the difficulty tenfold. Because of the way I set up my project, everything I installed 
		or configured had to be done through the linux command line which, while not incredibly complex, 
		was alien to me and took some serious trial and error before I was comfortable with it. All 
		things considered, this process could certainly have been more difficult, so I’m glad it went 
		relatively smoothly. My difficulties with even the simplest of steps throughout this project 
		served as a humbling reminder that no matter how much research I do, some things in life come 
		down to leaving your comfort zone and learning on the fly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, in order to expose my website to the internet while minimizing personal risk, I set up 
		my site to run through a Cloudflare tunnel before being served to clients. A Cloudflare tunnel 
		acts as a middleman between my web server and the end user, allowing their device to request 
		content from Cloudflare’s servers rather than directly from my own, protecting my personal 
		information. While this one part of the project is not self-hosted, setting up my own security 
		system would have required delving much deeper into this project than I intend to for now. For 
		someone like me who doesn’t want to get into the nitty gritty of web security, tools like 
		Cloudflare and Docker help to create a safer and much more manageable environment to work in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that my website is set up, aside from a few strange bugs that I had to iron out over a couple 
		of days, all that stands between me and a completed project is developing the actual web page. 
		While I am making great strides towards reaching this goal, the site isn’t quite ready to be put 
		on display for the world yet. However, this blog and its corresponding podcast version are currently 
		being hosted on the site as a proof of concept!
	</p>
	<p>
		As I write this, the site has been up reliably for multiple weeks, which inspires me with nothing but 
		confidence for the future of this project. Hosting my own website has taught me that the control and 
		independence that I long for online comes at the cost of persistence and a deep dedication to learning, 
		two attitudes that I’ve found go a long way in any situation where I want to achieve excellent results.
